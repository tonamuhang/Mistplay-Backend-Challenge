# Mistplay-Backend-Challenge
TODO List:
1. Node.js setup - Done
2. Create database in MongoDB with AWS - Done
3. Integrate node js backend with React-native to create an android app.(Need to research a little) - Not done. Possibly
to be updated in 48 hours.
4. (If time permits)Possible update for better UI. - Not Done. Possibly to be updated in 48 hours.


Note: 
1. You can run the android app through the provided link:
[Here](https://expo.io/@tonami/MistplayChallenge) by following
the instructions given on the website. This is only the front end.
2. Make sure you have npm installed. You can run the node.js server by going inside of 
the `backend` folder inside of the `mistplay-backend-challenge` folder and then run: ```npm start``` to start the 
database server. You can test the queries by using 
applications like Postman. Additionally, you can run `npm start` inside of the
`mistplay-backend-challenge` folder to start a front end and check the query results from there.

3. Unfortunately I'm not familiar with Android development(It's in fact my first 
android app), so I
haven't found a way to connect the front end and back end together. I'm
planning to research about it in the next 48 hours.
